Files and Assets for the Covid Business Directory

In this repository you will find two files to help you if you're running a clone of [okforok.com](https://okforok.com)

In order to make the process easier, we have two files available. 

1. [submit-a-business.json](https://github.com/rileyrichter/okforok/blob/master/submit-a-business.json)
2. [submit-a-server.json](https://github.com/rileyrichter/okforok/blob/master/submit-a-server.json)

These are JSON files that you can download and import straight into your own blank Integromat Scenario. See [this GIF](https://share.getcloudapp.com/xQug5gPm) to see how to import.
     
 This means you no longer need to build your own scenarios, you can now just link your accounts and map the data to make this work properly. Video coming soon.
